# About project

We used disaster messages to build ML model that classifies messages to specific categories in real time. Web app shows the result of the codes.
The screenshots of web app provided below.

# Instructions

Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up database and model:

To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database 'python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disasterresponse.db'
To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves 'python models/train_classifier.py data/disasterresponse.db models/classify.pkl'

Run the following command in the app's directory to run web app 'python run.py'
